MENU UPDATESSSSS
- Implement menu as a stack.
Eg: if on main menu, stack is:

0 | MAIN MENU 

If the user then clicks "Create Game":

1 | GAME SETUP 
0 | MAIN MENU 

Then, if the user goes back and clicks "Load game" the stack would pop off Game Set up and add load game:
1 | LOAD GAME 
0 | MAIN MENU
